    <h2>Important:</h2>
    <p>Rules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            First step: Each player pulls out one figure at a time.
        </li>
        <li>
            Second step: Battle begins. Please note that if you want to move a figure, first click on the button 'move',
            than choose your figure by <strong>left clicking</strong> on it and in green it will show all possible
            positions for the figure, then <strong>right click</strong> the cell you want to put your figure in.
            If you want to attack your opponent's figure, first click on 'attack' <strong>left click</strong> on the
            figure you want to attack with and then <strong>right click</strong> on the figure you want to attack.
            Finally, if you want to heal a figure, use button 'heal' and then just left click on it. In a random way
            this may give you a bonus turn.
            Use it wisely.
        </li>
        <li>Third step: Have fun.</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="notice">
        Warning: Programmer apologizes if the game becomes too slow. Be patient and wait for it to finish its inside
        processing. If you use it correctly, it will be kind enough to work properly. Please treat it in the way you
        treat the people you love. This would be highly appreciated.
    </p>
